What happesn when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, a hidden folder (.git) is created containing your revision history.  This tells git to keep track of the contents of this directory.

Adding more stuff to try to get this to work.

Adding yet more stuff, sigh....

What happesn when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, a hidden folder (.git) is created containing your revision history.  This tells git to keep track of the contents of this directory.

Adding more stuff to try to get this to work.

Adding yet more stuff, sigh....

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area contains a list of the files to be commited.  Commiting only certain files in a given commit allows only files that need to be changed together to updated as part of the same commit.  This might allow more collaboration -- since some people could work with one subset of files and other people could work with a nother subset of files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Use git diff after adding a file to the staging area but before editing it.
